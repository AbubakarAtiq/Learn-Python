#python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of brackets. The standard
# python indentation is 4 spaces, although tabs and any other space size will work,
# as long as it is consistent. Notice that code blocks do not need any termination.#
#Example is shown below:
statement=False
another_stat=True
if statement is True:
    #do something
    print(2)
    pass
elif another_stat is True: #else if
    print(1)
    #do something
    pass
else:
    #do something
    pass
