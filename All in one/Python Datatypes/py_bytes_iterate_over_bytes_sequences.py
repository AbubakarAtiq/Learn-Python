name='''Python bytes is a sequence. Therefore, we can use iterate over it using a looping technique.\nIn the following example, we will use for loop to iterate over the bytes of the Python bytes object.\nPython Program:'''
bytesobj=b'52s3a6'
for byte in bytesobj:
    print(byte)
'''
The byte values are the integer representations. So, we are seeing numbers in the output for each byte.
