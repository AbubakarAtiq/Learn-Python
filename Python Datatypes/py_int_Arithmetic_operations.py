s='''Python Int-Arithmetic Operations\nWe can perform all arithmetic operations with integers as operands.\nIn the following example, we shall take two integers in a and b, and perform arithmetic operations with these integers as operands for arithmetic operators.\nPython Program:'''
a,b=3,4
print(s)
#addition
print("a+b=",a+b)
#subtraction
print("a-b=",a-b)
#multiplication
print("a*b",a*b)
#integer division
print("a//b=",a//b)
#float division
print("a/b=",a/b)
