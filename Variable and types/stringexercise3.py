# There are additional variations on defining strings that make it easier to include things such as carriage returns, backslashes and Unicode characters.
#  These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but are covered in the Python documentation.

# Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:
one=1
two=2
three=one + two
print(three)
hello="hello"
world="world"
helloworld=hello+" "+world
print(helloworld)
