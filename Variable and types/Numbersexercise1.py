# Variables and Types
# Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". 
# You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type.
#  Every variable in Python is an object.

# This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
# Numbers
# Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and 
# floating point numbers(decimals).
myint=7
zahidiqbal=2
tlp=1
print(myint,zahidiqbal,tlp)
